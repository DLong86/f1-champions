				The FIA does not officially declare the Champion until the end of the
				season, but a driver is said to have "clinched" the Championship after
				it is no longer possible for another to obtain more points than him,
				even if the former driver were to not compete in the remaining races of
				the season, and the latter to score the maximum number of points
				possible. The Drivers' Championship has been won in the final race of
				the season 29 times in the 70 seasons it has been awarded. The earliest
				in a season that the Drivers' Championship has been clinched was in
				2002, when{" "}
